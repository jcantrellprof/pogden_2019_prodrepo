Hello readers, my name is Jasper and I am a scientist with a background in protein and viral production and analysis. Science is a passion of mine, and to meet modern demands I have recently taken up Data Analytics and Bioinformatics to explore the many wonderful and exciting studies available to the public.
I hope you enjoy the article and please take some time to read the source literature. A lot of work goes into the studies, and XXX.

Introduction:
This article represents an exercise in using data analytics to evaluate publicly available data, in this case analyzing data from an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid engineering study. AAV is a popular vector for gene therapy and enables the delivery of genetic information to correct genetic diseases. The viral capsid is a 60-mer protein complex, composed of splice variants of the viral protein (VP1, VP2, and VP3) which form the capsid in an approximate 1:1:10 ratio. This complex can carry a genome up to 4.7 kilobase in size into cells and deliver it into the nucleus where it can be read off and the therapeutic element carried by it can be produced.

This article will focus on the productivity of AAVs produced by this study, as well look at some potential mechanisms as to why certain mutants have higher productivities. AAV has historically suffered from poor yields, making it expensive to manufacture. If an engineered AAV has higher yields, then it could be manufactured at a lower cost. These lower costs would then allow any gene therapy built from it to be cheaper and more accessible to patients. Currently, AAV treatments can cost millions of dollars and decreasing this cost is a major effort in the field.

The data used in this analysis comes from the Comprehensive AAV capsid fitness landscape reveals a viral gene and enables machine-guided design study published in Science in 2019, run by Pierce Ogden, Eric Kelsic and Sam Sinai out of the Church lab at Harvard (Ogden, Kelsic, Sinai, & Church, 2019). Pierce Ogden is a co-founder and CSO of Manifold Bio, a company innovating next generation in-vivo platforms, and Eric Kelsic and Sam Sinai are co-founders of Dyno Therapeutics, a well-known AAV capsid engineering company merging modern in-silica tools with high-throughput platforms. George Church is a leader in genetics and the gene therapy field and has a lab at Harvard University in Massachusetts.
The paper is a trove of information, and a landmark paper in the shift towards using in-silica tools to assist in AAV engineering. It is also the first publication to identify the membrane associated accessory (MAAP), a member of frame-shifted proteins contained in the viral protein gene.

The Data:
The dataset we will be focusing on here is a small part of the study. The authors systematically mutated each of the available 735 amino acids positions of AAV2, as well as insertion sites between the core sequence positions. Instead of changing every amino acid to another, the authors changed the native codon to every other codon. Each codon was tagged with a barcode, and these barcodes were tracked at the plasmid and AAV generation stages. By counting the barcodes present, the authors could find the relative amount of each mutant in each library.

The libraries were designed by building genomes with either a REP or CMV promoter, followed by the mutant capsid sequence, followed by the barcode. The plasmids were generated and pooled to create two plasmid libraries, a REP and a CMV library. The plasmid libraries were then used to produce AAV libraries in duplicate using HEK293T cells. These AAV libraries were analyzed for productivity, thermostability and biodistribution in mice. This article will focus on how well each mutant produced and delve deeper into that data to look for regions and mutants of interest.

The Data: Processing
For this analysis, all data was taken from the GEO entry GSE139657. Python was used to process the data as described below. The scripts can be found at the associated github repository.
The analysis begins by replicating the data processing described in the paper’s supplement. The primary data we will be looking at is the barcode counts, as measured by how many times the barcodes appeared after Illumina sequencing (Ogden, Kelsic, Sinai, & Church, 2019). 
The plasmid and AAV datasets were first separated by their promoters and each viral replicate was processed independently. The data were grouped by position and amino acid pairs, summing the grouped barcode counts for each pair. This brought the number of unique entities per process from over 200,000 to 30,846. These individual summed values were then divided by the total of all the counts for each replicate, generating a frequency value for each mutant. This value represents the fraction of the total library an individual mutant is present at.

To account for imbalances in the plasmid library and unintentionally biasing results, a selection value was generated by dividing the AAV frequency by the plasmid frequency for each matching amino acid-position pair. Lastly, a set of 22 wild-type amino acids were isolated and the median of the selection values used to generate a single wild-type production value. All selection values were then divided by this value, generating a normalized selection value relative to wild-type AAV. This value will be referred to as normalized production for this analysis. AAV library duplicates were then averaged to generate a mean normalized productivity value, representing the final productivity values for this analysis. The CMV library data was used for the productivity analysis, as it was the library used for follow-up experiments in the source study.

The Data: High-level Analysis
For this analysis, python was used for all filtering, grouping, generation of statistics and generation of graphs. Excel was used to format tables. The scripts can be found at the associated github repository.
For the initial analysis of AAV productivity, the dataset was filtered by normalized productivity values, segmenting the data into viable, deleterious and highly productive mutants. Further filtering for positions amenable or deleterious to mutate was done, as well as evaluating positions and regions uniquely amenable to certain amino acid families.
The threshold to consider a mutant viable was a normalized productivity of at least 0.1, or 10% of wild type productivity. If a mutant fell below this threshold, it was considered deleterious and not viable for real world production. The highly productive group contained only mutants with a normalized productivity of 1.5, or 1.5-fold better than wild type productivity. Of 30,846 mutants, 17,412 passed as viable and 14,434 were considered deleterious. 717 mutants passed the highly productive threshold, with a high of normalized productivity of 11.64.

Histograms of the three groups clearly show certain regions are more amenable to mutation than others (Figure 1). Most viable mutants appear in the 0-200 sequence range, with a sharp drop off until position 400. The scatterplots reveal that the most highly productive mutants appear at or near certain sequence positions. This is highlighted in the highly productive group, with the histogram showing seven regions of interest we will follow later, highlighted in Table 1.

Viable and deleterious sets were further grouped by position, adding up the number of mutants appearing at each position for each dataset. Positions that had 20 or more mutants in the viable group were considered positions amenable to mutagenesis, and positions with 20 or more mutants in the deleterious group were considered positions deleterious to mutate. These positions were then graphed, and the amenable and deleterious positions overlaid (Figure 2). Similar to the viable and deleterious mutant graphs in Figure 1, the sequence ranges from 0-200, and 400-600 are more amenable to mutagenesis compared to positions 200-400. The region after position 600 appears to have the most overlap of amenable and deleterious positions across the entire sequence, although this region does not appear in many of the later analysis.

The Data: Analyzing Mutants by Amino Acid Character
To explore if the general character (charge, size, etc) of certain regions in the sequence is important, filters were created to represent amino acid families of a particular character. The acidic family, characterized by negatively charged residues, includes aspartate (D) and glutamate (E). The basic family, characterized by positive charges, consists of arginine (R), lysine (K), and histidine (H). The hydrophobic family includes amino acids with uncharged residues, such as leucine (L), isoleucine (I), valine (V), methionine (M), and cysteine (C). Lastly, the aromatic family is characterized by large uncharged or partially charged residues, including phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y). The remaining amino acids, serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, alanine, glycine and proline, were not considered for the analysis described here.

These filters were applied to the viable dataset to group mutants by family, with mutants further categorized based on whether they occurred at core positions or insertion sites. To standardize the analysis between families of different sizes, a normalized value was calculated by dividing the total count of mutants in each family by the number of amino acids included in that family (Figure 3).

The tables reveal basic amino acids are the least prevalent in the viable dataset. The acidic amino acid family appears the second least, but has a unique characteristic not seen in the other families. The acidic family has a higher ratio of insertion positions to core positions. This observation carries over when we look at positions uniquely amenable to a single amino acid family (Figure 3). In the histogram, we can see positions where acidic amino acids are favored appear in dense clusters, rather than the more dispersed clusters of other families, suggesting that that this family is specifically amenable in these areas. When comparing the viable and highly productive groups, we can see acidic amino acids are also enriched in the highly productive dataset. Notably, the clusters for the acidic acid family overlap with regions of interest R1, R4, R5, R6 and R7.
The Data: Regions of Interest

Early analysis of the highly productive mutant dataset revealed seven regions of interest where there are high mutant counts and normalized productivity. Table 1 shows the sequence positions that each region of interest spans. Graphs were generated for each region, highlighting the amino acids and normalized productivity for each mutant at each position. The top 100 mutants and top 25 most recurring positions were filtered out for closer examination (Table 2, Table 3).

Regions R1, R2 and R3 are relatively sparse in the highly productive dataset and represent the regions with the least mutants and total productivity (Figure 4). The highlight here is in region 3, where the D184F mutant stands as the highest productivity mutant of the set with a normalized productivity of 11.64. Position K142 in region 2 also comes in as one of the most common positions appearing in the highly productive dataset (Table 3).

Regions R4, R5, R6 and R7 all span the 400-600 sequence range (Figure 5). These regions can be characterized by positions with a high amenability to mutation, and their immediate neighbors. Region R4 is dominated by the amenable positions R447, N449 and R459. Position R471A stands as the highest producing mutant in this region (normalized productivity of 8.3), with four other mutants at this position appearing in the top 100 mutants by productivity. The region holds nine spots overall in the top 100 by productivity (Table 2).

Region R5 is a dense region, holding nine of the top 25 most recurring positions in the highly productive dataset. 37 of the top 100 mutants also appear in this region, along with the second most common position appearing in the highly productive dataset, K490. This region also holds the second and third most productive mutants in the set, K507W and N496F at 10.45 and 10.06 normalized productivities respectively. Region R6 is less dense and focused around three positions, H526, K532, and F533. This region has the only deletions appearing in the top 100 mutants at positions Q536 and S537.

Region of interest R7 is the densest of the seven regions. The region contains 49 of the top 100 mutants, and nine of the top 25 positions in the highly productive group. Position R588 stands as the position appearing the most in the highly productive group, with R585 as the third. Interestingly, of the nine positions appearing in the top 25 most recurring positions, six are insertion sites. This is highlighted as position 591.5 (A591_T592insE) stands as the third most productive mutant in the whole set with a normalized productivity of 10.27. The 591.5 position seems to be a critical region where acidic residues have a significant effect on AAV productivity (Figure 5). This carries over into the top 100 mutants set, where 24 of the 31 insertion sites in the top 100 mutants are in this region.

Discussion: Top Hits and Relevant Literature
This article focuses on the analysis of the productivity of 30,846 AAV mutants produced in the Comprehensive AAV capsid fitness landscape reveals a viral gene and enables machine-guided design study. A future article will delve into the biodistribution data from this same study and reference the analysis here.
One of the interesting observations of the data is the lack of basic amino acids in the viable and highly productive groups. In fact, many of the most productive positions remove basic residues, like positions 471, 507 and 588, while others introduce acidic residues near basic residues. This suggests the positive charge negatively impacts AAV production in some way, and negating or removing it can improve productivity.

The literature shows this observation could be tied to AAV2’s heparin sulfate binding. Heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is a common proteoglycan that appears on the surface of cells and acts as a receptor for many proteins. Positively charged patches are common as HSPG binding motifs (Xie et al., 2002), and this is the most well-studied receptor for AAV2. A 2003 study showed AAV has six critical residues involved in heparin sulfate binding, R484, R487, R585, R588, R475 and K532 (Kern et al., 2003).

In this analysis, four of these critical positions, positions R487, K532, R585 and R588, appear in the top 25 most recurring positions in the highly productive group. 20 of the top 100 mutants by productivity appear at one of these positions as well. Interestingly, none of these mutants were changed to acidic amino acids. In almost every case, the change was to a lightly charged or uncharged amino acid ranging from tryptophan (W) to serine (S). This suggests the increase in productivity is more about the removal or negation of positive charges on the surface of AAV and potentially disrupting HSPG binding, rather than increasing negative charges in certain areas.

In another study from 2019, a team managed to obtain a structure of AAV bound with AAVR, another critical receptor and component for several AAV serotype’s entry pathway (Zhang et al., 2019).  While many AAV positions highlighted from that study do not appear in the top 100 mutants. The two exceptions are positions R471 and K507. Position R471 and K507 both appear to interact with AAVR, but only mutations at R471 were shown to reduce AAVR binding. Both positions appear 15 times in the top 100 mutants, and position K507 appears in the top 25 most recurring positions. While the 2019 study shows K507 does not appear to have as important of a role as R471, mutating either seems to benefit AAV production in this analysis.

The literature has established several well studied hypervariable regions (HVRs), identified by sequence heterogeneity between the different serotypes (Govindasamy et al., 2006). Here, the regions of interest R4-R7 overlap with several of these HVRs (Table 4). Coincidentally, region of interest R4 (445-450) overlaps with HVR4 (449-468), R5 (485-510) overlaps with HVR5 (487-504), R6 (525-540) with HVR6 (525-541) and lastly R7 (575-600) with HVR8 (579-594). HVR8 is the most well-known, as it contains the R585 and R588 positions critical to HSPG binding and is a site very amenable to peptide insertion. In this analysis, the R585 and R588 are two of the most prevalent positions changed in the highly productive dataset, and the density of amenable insertion positions in ROI R7 correlates with the region’s historic amenability to peptide insertions.

Returning to the source paper, many of the same observations made in this analysis are made by the authors. When the team filtered for mutants in the hypervariable regions, they found there was a greater average “fitness”, i.e. productivity, compared to the rest of the sequence. Mutants adding basic amino acids were found to be more deleterious in general, and adding negative charges was beneficial in particular to the 3-fold axis region. While not done in this analysis, the source paper makes some further observations concerning the AAV2 capsid structure and the data. They also found mutations in the AAV2 sequence that matched amino acids in other serotypes at the same positions were also more amenable (Ogden, Kelsic, Sinai, & Church, 2019).

Final Thoughts:
This analysis suggests that there is a correlation between the loss of positive charges, especially in key regions of interest, and an increase in AAV productivity. A short literature review shows many of the most productive mutants found in this analysis change positions important for binding to cellular receptors, inferring a negative correlation between function and productivity.

Having produced many serotypes in HEK293 cells, I can confirm the general trend of poor productivity for serotypes that are strong transducers of HEK293 cells. AAV2 is a notoriously poor producer in HEK293 suspension cells but remains one of the strongest transducers of HEK293 cells. Conversely, AAV8 and AAV9 do not transduce HEK293 cells well and are some of the best producers (Weinmann et al., 2022, Westhaus et al., 2020). Common AAV2 mutants that inhibit HSPG binding, such as R585A or R588A mutants, can reach yields similar to AAV8 further supporting the trend. Even work presented at ASGCT 2024 even shows inhibition of AAV transduction during AAV production can improve AAV yields (E, 2024), further suggesting AAV with a strong transduction ability will produce poorly if it transduces the cell type it is made in.

The source paper, Comprehensive AAV capsid fitness landscape reveals a viral gene and enables machine-guided design, continues to use the libraries generated for a variety of experiments. A follow-up article will explore the mouse distribution data and correlate that data back to the results from this analysis.

That concludes this article, thank you for reading. I recommend reviewing the source paper, reference 1 in the references. As mentioned in the introduction, the team behind this study is at the forefront of adapting advanced in-silica tools into modern biotech. Many are well known leaders in the gene therapy field as well. I thank the authors for making the data publicly available and recommend it to anyone who wants to practice data analytics in the biotech field.
